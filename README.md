# i-know-vue
Respository showcasing my Vue.js projects; their implementation, my learning progess, and how these projects increase my potential positive impact in a future role within my software engineering career. For this specific app, I'm using Vue 3 and Vite tooling to make up an SPA. Some routes will include links to other vue related projects I'm doing that use slightly different tooling. For example, Vue is a progressive Javascript framework that can build out UI in other ways, such as:

1. Enhancing static HTML without a build step
2. Embedding as Web Components on any page
3. Single-Page Application (SPA) --> this is the one I'm using for this app
4. Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
5 Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
6. Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal

## Getting started

On the home page you can see easy to use navigation to explore different Vue projects I've been working on. If you think these are skills you need employed, reach out to me and lets chat about my potential future employment.

## IDE Setup

Using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
